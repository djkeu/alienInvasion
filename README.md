# alienInvasion


What the project does
- Create an alien invasion type shooting game as described in Python Crash Course.


Why the project is useful (to me)
- Some unintentional uses:
    - Learn to write a meaningful readme.
    - Get vsCode to work with Github repositories.
        - Solve conflict while sharing a repo between remote and two local machines.
    - Learn Git and Github. That's gonna take some more time than I hoped for.
    - Added index.txt to hopefully keep oversight of the lessons in the book.
    
- Learn to program with Python.
    - Python Crash Course p.225, Alien Invasion.
    - alien_invasion.py
